References Manager for SDLMs
==========

The References Manager goal is simple: automate the usage of references in SDLMs. It consists of two files, refShow.js and [brand name].references.json. 

The References Manager speeds up building an SDLM a little and experience has shown that it greatly speeds up editing, especially if any references are deleted or shuffled. Also, by handing off work to JavaScript that would otherwise have to be done by hand it makes the whole process smoother.
